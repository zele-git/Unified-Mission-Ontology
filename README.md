# Unified-Mission-Ontology
A unified mission ontology for the purpose of mission engineering. 
This survey has been designed to investigate the understanding, conceptualization, and representation of mission, and to define a reasonable abstraction and representation of mission that can be used for mission engineering purposes. Having a clear understanding and representation of the mission concept aid practitioners in implementing and executing mission engineering in a more structured way. One of the challenges regarding this is the broad use of the mission concept across different disciplines, lacking conventionally accepted definitions, and resulting ambiguity of its essences and applications. This work will contribute to the establishment of organized knowledge around mission and mission-based analysis and engineering for practitioners by creating unified views and viewpoints. Our investigation is not limited to assessing the research landscape on mission representation; we examine consistency, completeness, coverage, and sufficiency of the existing representations based on the Mission Engineering Guide.
